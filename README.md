The game consists of three screens:

 - **Home screen:**
Displays basic instructions and waits for user to click when ready
 - **Game screen:**
On one hand, it paints background, stage and zombies and, on the other hand, it is in charge of generating zombies when necessary and eliminating those that have been killed.
 - **Final screen:**
Shows the total score and waits for the user to click for restart.
